# hello-world
I am doing a thing!

I made a spelling mistake. I wrote that I was ding a thing. Oooops. Oh and I'm kind of ill today. 
Sorry if you catch anything reading this!

Erm, but yeah I've been doing some code stuff recently. I'm not good at cooking so it's nice I can do something.

var ingredients = kindaTastyLooking

function cooking {
  ingredients = kindaBadLooking;
  }
  
See I can do things!
